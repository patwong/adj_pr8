- created milestone checklist in notes to monitor progress

2019.08.08
- modified Player model
	- removed 'player_name' as primary key for Player because name may not be unique
	- added 'player_id' (for pro-fb ref) to Player
	- allow django to create default 'id' as unique identifier for Player
- modified PlayerSeason model
	- add passer_rating to be a column in the PlayerSeason table for now
- existing tables in adj_pr8 db removed for fresh initial migration; modifying primary keys too messy
